MUD code is pretty easy to understand even for newbies.
It could useful to see how network game engine works.
From other point of view, 90% of Forgotten Dungeon code was written by
non-professionals, by students who just started to learn C language.

We have used CVS, but the repository was lost and changes.txt is the only
file which contains some history notes.
