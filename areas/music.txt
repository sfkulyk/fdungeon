Who wants to live forever~
There's no time for {Gus{x,
There's no place for {Gus{x,
What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us.

Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever.....?
There's no chance for us,
It's all decidede for us,
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us.

Who wants to live forever.
Who dares to live forever,
When love must {Rdie{x.

But touch my tears with your lips,
Touch my world with your fingertips,
And we can have forever,
And we can love forever,
Forever is our today,
Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever,
Forever is our today,
Who waits forever anyway?

A Kind Of Magic~
It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
A kind of magic,
One dream, one soul, one prize,
One goal, one golden glance of what should be,
It's a kind of magic,
One shaft of light that shows the way,
No mortal man can win this day,
It's a kind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
Is challenging the doors of time,
It's a kind of magic,
The waiting seems eternity,
The day will down of sanity,
Is this the kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
There can be only one,
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done,
This flame that burns inside of me,
I'm here in secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
Is challenging the doors of time,
It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
The rage that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be, will soon be,
Will soon be done,
This is a kind of magic,
There can be only one,
The rage that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be done,
Magic - it's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
Magic, magic, magic, magic,
It's magic,
It's a kind of magic.

Yesterday~
     Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away,
     Now it looks as though they're here to stay,
     Oh, I believe in yesterday.

     Suddenly I'm not half a man I used to be,
     There's a shadow hanging over me,
     Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

         Why she has to go? I don't know, she wouldn't say.
         I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

     Yesterday love was such an easy game to play,
     Now I need a place to hide away,
     Oh, I believe in yesterday.

         Why she has to go? I don't know, she wouldn't say.
         I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.

     Yesterday love was such an easy game to play,
     Now I need a place to hide away,
     Oh, I believe in yesterday,

Comfortably Numb~
Hello hello helo...
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me.
Is there anyone home?
Come on, now.
I hear you're feeling down.
Well I can ease your pain,
Get you on your feet again.
Relax relax relax...
I need some information first.
Just the basic facts:
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
When I was a child I had a fever.
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I got that feeling once again.
I can't explain, you would not understand.
This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb.
Ok ok ok...
Just a little pinprick. <ping>
There'll be no more --Aaaaaahhhhh!
But you may feel a little sick.
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working. Good.
That'll keep you going for the show.
Come on it's time to go.
There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're sayin'.
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
Out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone.
I cannot put my finger on it now.
The child is grown, the dream is gone.
I have become comfortably numb.

Crash Boom Bang!~
   My Papa told me to stay out of trouble
   "When you've find your man, make sure he's for real!".
   I've learned that nothing really lasts forever
   I sleep with the scars I wear that won't heal
   They won't heal.

   Cos every time I seem to fall in love
   Crash! Boom! Bang!
   I find the heart but then I hit the wall
   Crash! Boom! Bang!
   That's the call, that's the game
   And the pain stays the same.

   I'm walking down this empty road to nowhere
   I pass by the houses and blocks I once knew.
   My Mama told me not to mess with sorrow
   But I always did, and Lord, I still do
   I'm still breaking the rules
   I kick it up, I kick it down.

   Cos every time I seem to fall in love
   Crash! Boom! Bang!
   I find the heart but then I hit the wall
   Crash! Boom! Bang!
   That's my real middle-name
   It has always been the same
   That's the call, that's the game
   And the pain stays the same.

   I still feel the heat
   Slowly fallin' from the sky
   And the taste of the kissing
   Shattered by rain
   Comin' tumblin' from behind
   And the wild holy war.
   I kick it up, I kick it down
   And every time I seem to fall in love
   Crash! Boom! Bang!
   I find the roses dying on the floor
   Crash! Boom! Bang!
   That's the call, that's the game
   And the pain stays the same.
   That's my real middle-name
   It has always been the same.

   Oh Yeah Oh Yeah Oh Yeah Uh-Huh
   Been the same, been the same
   It has always been the same.

Imagine~
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

The Joker~
Some people call me the space cowboy.
Yea...
Some call me the gangster of love.
Some people call me Maurice.
Cause I speak of the pompotous of love.
People talk about me baby.
Say I'm doing you wrong, doing you wrong.
Well you worry, baby, don't worry.
Cause I'm right here, right here,
Right here, right here at home.
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner,
I'm a lover, I'm a sinner.
I play my music in the sun.
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker.
I'm midnight toker.
I get my lovin' on the run.
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see.
I really love your peaches. Wanna shake your tree.
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time.
Ohey, baby, I'll sure show you a good time.
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner,
I'm a lover, I'm a sinner.
I play my music in the sun.
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker.
I'm midnight toker.
Sure don't want to hurt no one.
People keep talking about me, baby.
Say I'm doing you wrong.
Well you worry, don't worry,
No don't worry mama.
Cause I'm right here at home.
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see.
I really love your peaches. Wanna shake your tree.
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time.
Come on baby. Show me a good time.

One Of My Turns~
Oh my God, what a fabulous room!
Are all these your guitars?
This place is bigger than our apartment.
Uh, could I have a drink of water?
Ya want some?  Huh?
Oh wow!  Look at this tub!
Wanna take a bath?
What're you watching?
Hello?
Are you feeling ok?
Day after day,
Our love turns gray,
Like the skin on a dying man.
And night after night,
We pretend it's all right,
But I have grown older,
And you have grown colder,
And nothing is very much fun, anymore.
And I can feel,
One of all my turns coming on.
I feel,
Cold as a razor blade,
Tight as a tourniquet,
Dry as a funeral drum.
Run to the bedroom,
In the suitcase on the left,
You'll find my favorite axe.
Don't look so frightened,
This is just a passing phase,
One of my bad days.
Would you like to watch TV?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate a silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly?  -- Would ya?
Would you like to see me try?
Ooohh. No!
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?

Queensryche~
Silent Lucidity~
Hush now, don't you cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream
Spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over... or has it just begun?
There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize it and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly you hear and see
This magic new dimension
I will be watching over you
I am gonna help you see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you, in Silent Lucidity
Visualize your dream
Record it in the present tense
Put it into a permanent form
If you persist in your efforts
You can achieve dream control
Dream control
How's that then, better?
Hug me
If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin
Living twice at once you learn
You're safe from the pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly
A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but...
I will be watching over you
I am gonna help to see it through
I will protect you in the night
I am smiling next to you....

Goto sleep~
   There's a shadow on the terrace
   A snow dance for the living
   There's heavy weather on the way
   I heard on the news.

   And life's tough principal
   Who won't reward the losers
   Your name is on the tea-cup
   There's nothing I can do.

   But to wish you's think about me
   Before you go to sleep
   And I wish you the best there is
   Before you go to sleep.

   There are tears without the colour
   A million seas of water
   An ocean full of people
   Where shattered hearts can go.

   A love's a golden ripple
   Where answers are so simple
   But the explanations
   Are very hard to do.

   And I wish you's think about me
   Before you go to sleep
   And I wish you the best there is
   Before you go to sleep.
   Go to sleep.

Woman (какаЯ женщина)~
В шумном зале ресторана,
Средь весельЯ и обмана,
Пристань загулЯвшего поэта.
Возле столика напротив,
Ты сидишь в пол-оборота,
ВсЯ в луче ночного света.
Так само случилось вдруг,
Что слова сорвались с губ,
Закружило голову хмельную.
Ах какаЯ женщина,
какаЯ женщина,
Мне б такую.
Пол не чуЯ под собою,
Между небом и землею,
Как во сне с тобой танцую.
Аромат духов так манит,
ОпьЯнЯет и буЯнит,
Ах как сладко в нем тону Я.
Так близки наши тела,
И безумные слова,
Без стыда тебе шепчу Я..
Ах какаЯ женщина,
какаЯ женщина,
Мне б такую.
Ты уйдешь с другим Я знаю,
Он тебЯ давно ласкает,
И тебЯ домой не провожу Я.
Жжет в груди сильней огнЯ,
Не моЯ ты не моЯ,
Так зачем же Я ревную?
Сколько ж нужно мне вина,
Чтобы с памЯти прогнать,
И забыть мечту свою шальную..
Ах какаЯ женщина,
какаЯ женщина,
Мне б такую.

Fade to black~
Life is seems to fade away
Drifting further everyday
Getting lost within my soul
Nothing matters noone else

I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There's nothing more for me
I need the end to set me free

Things are got they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost this can't be real
I can't stand the pain I fear

Emptyness is filling me
To the point of loyalty
Growing darkness taking down
I was me but now he's gone...

The bards' song - In the forest~
Now you all know
the bards and their songs
When hours have gone by
I'll close my eyes
In a world far away
We may meet again
But now hear my song
'bout the dawn of the night
Let's sing the bards' song

Tomorrow will take us away
Far from home
Noone will ever know our names
But the bards' songs will remain
Tomorrow will take it away
The fear of today
It will be gone
Due to our magic songs

There's only one song
Left in my mind
Tales of a brave man
Who lived far from here
Now the bards' songs are over
And it's time to leave
Noone should ask you
For the name of the one
Who tells the story

Tomorrow will take us away
Far from home
Noone will ever know our names
But the bards' songs will remain
Tomorrow all will be known
And you're not alone
So don't be afraid in the dark and cold
'cause the bards' songs will remain
They all will remain
In my thoughts and in my dreams
They're always in my mind
These songs of hobbits dwarves and men
And elves come close your eyes
You can see
Them
Too...

I've lost my battle before it starts
My first breath wasn't gone
My spirit sunken deep into the ground
Why am i alone
I can hear my heartbeat
Silence all around

See hate will rise
So don't come closer fear your child
Born with a king's heart
But fate fooled me and changed my cards
Noone asked if I wanted it
If I liked it

I am the {rfallen one{x
A figure on an old game
No {mjokers{x on my side

And murder the dawn
I turned off the light

Nothing else but laughter is around me
Forewer more
Noone can heal me
Noone can save me
Noone can heal me
Wash away the blood from my hands
My father's blood
In agony
We unified
I never wanted to be
What they told me to be
Fullfill my fate and I'll be {Cfree{x

Say do you mean what you do
Just like a spark that fell aside or what
You're telling me you're lucky

Are you're afraid of me or why don't you look back

Do you really want it so 'cause

The time will come
When everything's too late

I'll never be like you
And you will end
Frustrated full of hate
Deep in the blackest hole

You don't like to see the world
Like it is
You try to change it all
You're in defence
Only appologize
You're telling me you're happy
But I know your lies

I look into your eyes and see your heart turns red
Like if you're wounded but no drop of blood is shed
You don't look for a cure instead you-re hurting me
You'll get me never

What is happened to your life?
Everything you had is missing

I don't want to be like you

Не отвечай, когда хамЯт, кричат мол Я герой

Живи, пока еще не пробил час
